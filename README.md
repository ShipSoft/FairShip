# FairShip

## Introduction

FairShip is the software framework for the SHiP experiment which is based on
FairRoot. The dependencies of FairShip are tracked and installed using
[alibuild](https://alisw.github.io/alibuild/).

All packages are managed in Git and GitHub. Please read [the Git tutorial for
SHiP](https://github.com/ShipSoft/FairShip/wiki/Git-Tutorial-for-SHiP) first,
even if you already know Git, as it explains how development is done on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

All needed pre-requisites are provided by the FairSoft package, see below.

Additionally for developers:
  * clang-format (to format code according to our style guide)
  * clang-tidy (to check coding conventions -- mostly naming rules which are not covered by `cpplint`)

## Build Instructions, following [the tutorial given at the Nov'17 collab meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/663423/contributions/2760156/attachments/1555373/2445724/Ship-Soft-CollaborationMeetingNov2017.pdf)
0. For a full installation go to step 3. If you work on lxplus, or on SLC6/CC7
   and have access to `/cvmfs/ship.cern.ch`, and you only want to install FairShip, define enviroment variables:
    ```bash
    export SHIPBUILD=/cvmfs/ship.cern.ch/SHiPBuild
    ```    

1. Install FairShip
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShipSoft/FairShip.git
    cd FairShip
    ./localBuild.sh
    ```    
2. Setup environment
    ```bash
    source FairShipRun/config.sh
    ```    

3. For a full installation on any linux system:
    ```bash
    mkdir SHiPBuild; cd SHiPBuild
    git clone https://github.com/ShipSoft/FairShip.git 
    FairShip/aliBuild.sh
    ```    

4. Setup environment
    ```bash
    alibuild/alienv enter (--shellrc) FairShip/latest
    ```    


## Run Instructions

Partial installation, step 1 of above :

```bash
source FairShipRun/config.sh
```    

If you have a full installation, step 3 of above:

```bash
alibuild/alienv enter (--shellrc) FairShip/latest
```    

Now you can for example simulate some events, run reconstruction and analysis:

```bash
python $FAIRSHIP/macro/run_simScript.py
>> Macro finished succesfully.
>> Output file is  ship.conical.Pythia8-TGeant4.root

python $FAIRSHIP/macro/ShipReco.py -f ship.conical.Pythia8-TGeant4.root -g geofile_full.conical.Pythia8-TGeant4.root
>> finishing pyExit

python -i $FAIRSHIP/macro/ShipAna.py -f ship.conical.Pythia8-TGeant4_rec.root -g geofile_full.conical.Pythia8-TGeant4.root
>> finished making plots
```

Run the event display:

```bash
python -i $FAIRSHIP/macro/eventDisplay.py -f ship.conical.Pythia8-TGeant4_rec.root -g geofile_full.conical.Pythia8-TGeant4.root
// use SHiP Event Display GUI
Use quit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exit
```

### Build Targets Related to C++ Code Style-Guide

The following targets are only available if `clang-format`, `clang-tidy` and `git` are installed.

Build targets indicated with `*` always come in three different flavors.
  * `no-suffix`: executes the target on source files that changed compared to origin/master -- e.g. `make check-format`
  * `-staged`: executes the target on source files that have been staged -- e.g. `make check-format-staged`
  * `-all`: executes the target on all source files in the project -- e.g. `make check-format-all`

| Target          | Description  |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| `check-format*` | run clang-format on selected files. Fails if any file needs to be reformatted |
| `show-format*` | run clang-format on selected files and display differences |
| `format*` | run clang-format on selected files and update them in-place |
| `check-tidy*` | run clang-tidy on selected files. Fails if errors are found |
| `show-tidy*` | run clang-tidy on selected files and display errors. |
| `tidy*` | run clang-tidy on selected files and attempt to fix any warning automatically |
| `check-cpplint*` | run cpplint on selected files. Fails if errors are found and displays them. |
| `check-submission` | will build, run all tests, check formatting, code style, and generate documentation and coverage report |
| `fix-submission` | will attempt to fix the reported issues using `clang-format` and `clang-tidy`. Failing build, tests, compiler warnings, issues from cpplint and warnings from doxygen must be fixed manually. Also some `clang-tidy` issues cannot be resolved automatically |
