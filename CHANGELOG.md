# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
Calendar Versioning (year.month), with the possibility of patch releases
(year.month.patch).

Until April 2024 (inclusive) no changelog was kept. We might try to reconstruct
it in future.

## Unreleased

### Added

* feat(python): Add experimental script to compare histograms
* feat(python): Add experimental script to check overlaps quickly
* **Corrections in MuonDIS simulation**
  The DIS interactions are now time-shifted to be consistent with the original incoming muon. Additionally, tracks from soft interactions of the original muon along with the muon's veto response are preserved (in muonDis.root) and included up to the DIS interaction point. To be noted that the muon veto points are manually added using add_muonresponse.py, which modifies the simulation file. This replaces the old method of "backward-travelling muon" to generate the incoming muon's veto response. All MuonDIS simulation scripts have been updated and consolidated within FairShip/muonDIS, ensuring consistency for new productions.
* Added a custom CrossSection branch to the simulation file to save the DIS cross sections from muonDIS.
* Added new warm muon shield `warm_opt` in geometry_config
* Added new parameters to muon shield to support configurations from current optimisation campaign
* Added event_inspector class to experimental analysis_toolkit to streamline usage of helper functions; Added dump_event() as a start.
* Add (optional) MgB2 field map
* ShipBFieldMap: Added LOG info and fatal
* Folder ```SND``` is added for new versions of SND integrated to the Muon Shield
* First version of ```MTC``` (```SND/MTC```) is introduced. Scint part is fully implemented, the Sci-Fi part is implemented in simplified version. Geometrical parameters of ```MTC``` are stored in ```geometry/MTC_config.yaml``` file
* New key for ```macro/run_simScript.py``` for choosing SND options is added: ```--SND_design```
* Geometry_config.py: Added MS design `New_HA_Design` based on the MS `warm_opt`  with new version of HA
* Add access to decoded numbers (stations, views etc.) of strawtubes hits

* fix(shipDet_conf.py): changing paths to yaml files to more pythonic (```os.path.join()``` now)
* Fix splitcal strip dimensions and number of modules
* fix: Ensure the web viewer is disabled when checking for geometry overlaps (workaround for https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/18881)
* fix(EvtCalc): Fix crash due to string formatting
* Fix: Field direction of first magnet section 2 was wrong

## 24.11

Release after first round of breaking changes. Requires CVMFS release ≥ 24.10.
Tagged for launch of background simulations.

### Added

* **EventCalc LLP event generator**
  This modification introduces a first implementation of the EventCalc decay
  event sampler in FairShip for inclusive final states. For further details,
  consult the dedicated presentation at the 30th SHiP CM
  [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1448055/contributions/6142341/attachments/2939894/5165450/SHiP_collaboration_meeting_talk_MFerrillo.pdf). See also #528.
* Add a conversion script `FairShip/macro/convertEvtCalc.py` to convert the
  EventCalc output sampled kinematics (.dat) as input to the simulation script
  (.root). _Remark_: This will eventually become unnecessary when this
  conversion is implemented within the EventCalc tool itself.
