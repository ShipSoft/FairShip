# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
Calendar Versioning (year.month), with the possibility of patch releases
(year.month.patch).

Until April 2024 (inclusive) no changelog was kept. We might try to reconstruct
it in future.

## Unreleased

### Added

* feat(python): Add experimental script to compare histograms
* feat(python): Add experimental script to check overlaps quickly
* **Corrections in MuonDIS simulation**
  The DIS interactions are now time-shifted to be consistent with the original incoming muon. Additionally, tracks from soft interactions of the original muon along with the muon's veto response are preserved (in muonDis.root) and included up to the DIS interaction point. To be noted that the muon veto points are manually added using add_muonresponse.py, which modifies the simulation file. This replaces the old method of "backward-travelling muon" to generate the incoming muon's veto response. All MuonDIS simulation scripts have been updated and consolidated within FairShip/muonDIS, ensuring consistency for new productions.
* Added a custom CrossSection branch to the simulation file to save the DIS cross sections from muonDIS.
* Added new warm muon shield `warm_opt` in geometry_config
* Added new parameters to muon shield to support configurations from current optimisation campaign
* Added event_inspector class to experimental analysis_toolkit to streamline usage of helper functions; Added dump_event() as a start.
* Add (optional) MgB2 field map
* ShipBFieldMap: Added LOG info and fatal

### Fixed

* chore: Fix file endings
* chore: trim trailing whitespace
* Fix mismatch dimension cavern ECN3 TCC8
* fix: use standard library to expand env
* fix: autoload Pythia8 instead of manually loading in run_simScript.py
* fix(geometry): fix typo of "vacuums" for strawtubes medium
* fix(reco): Fix segmentation fault due to dummy containers (#453, #519)
* fix: don't use TFile's deprecated attribute syntax
* fix(digi): Fix logic of SST digitisation (#662)
* Fix double append of recognized stracks
* fix(ShieldUtils.py): The fieldmap offset was calibrated with the old version of MS

### Changed

* Don't special case EOS paths (fix #566)
* Setting up the Muon shield geometry by ROOT files is completely replaced with the temporary solution of dict in the `geometry/geometry_config.py`.
* Set up of the shield name is now done using the `--shieldName` flag instead of `--scName`.
* Allow using standalone TPythia for use with ROOT 6.32+
* Use git-lfs to track ROOT files
* shipDet_conf behaviour no longer depends on the muon shield version.
* feat(digi): Use STL vectors for SST digitisation
* feat(digi): Use STL vectors for SBT digitisation
* Change max x of stereo hits to match straw length
* Get rid of straw diameter dependency in scale factor
* Assume all tracks are muons during track fit (avoid using MC truth)
* Change of UBT geometry, remove implementation of RPC and setting a new scoring plane of 4×6 m
* Allow specifying spectrometer field map

### Removed

* fix: Remove unused, unrunnable shipPatRec_prev.py
* feat(geometry): Dropped support for old geometries without DecayVolumeMedium explicitly set(pre 24.11 release case).
* MS: Removed old options 7, 9, 10
* MS: Removed cobalt option
* MS: Removed stepGeo option
* MS: Removed the flag constant field in Absorber (HS) -> fixed to 1.7 T
* MS: run_simScript.py: The --noSC flag is removed, whether or not a configuration is SC hybrid depends on the config selected. Configurations are defined in the shield_db in geometry_config.py
* Removed old nuTauTargetDesign configurations from 0 to 2. Currently supported: 3 (2018, magnetized target) and 4 (Current, not magnetized target and spectrometer)
* build(field,nutaudet): remove unnecessary ROOT_INCLUDE_DIR include
* feat(geometry): Remove 2018, 2022 global designs

## 25.01

### Added

* New analysis toolkit prototype added as part of the 'experimental' package.
* Simple analysis example script now available in 'examples/'

### Fixed

* Use ConstructedAt + std::swap to replace removed pythonization for TCA
* Octant symmetry was incorrect for B_z when using field maps (reported and fixed by M. Ferro-Luzzi)
* Tof calculation corrected in GenieGenerator.cxx, wrong units previously used.
* Genfit measurements now give the correct detector ID
* Fix TEvePointSetPrintOut
* Event Display: Fix drawing of MC and Geo tracks
* AddressOf is outdated function in ROOT, changed with addressof (in field/)

### Changed
* Changed the dimension of the cave (ref. https://indico.cern.ch/event/1507466/contributions/6345273/attachments/3003438/5293503/Quick%20Update%20on%20FAIRSHIP%20geometry-1.pdf):
	1) Updated dimensions of TCC8 and ECN3.
	2) Added a step in ECN3.
	3) Removed the coat of the absorber.
	4) Modified the dimensions of the HA and absorber.

* Set Decay Volume Medium as helium (previously vacuums),can be explicitly switched to vacuum with --vacuums.
* Medium of SST boxes will be the same as DecayVolumeMedium (previously, always vacuum)
* Don't prune tracks (before we were using the CFL option to Track::prune, see https://github.com/GenFit/GenFit/blob/e81adeb07c8643301a1d9f7ae25048557cc72dff/core/include/Track.h#L298)
* **EventCalc LLP event generator**
This modification to the EventCalc interface accommodates for generic N-body LLP decays.

### Removed

* Remove Millepede
* Remove outdated example shipEvent_ex.py
* Remove ALPACA generator

## 24.11

Release after first round of breaking changes. Requires CVMFS release ≥ 24.10.
Tagged for launch of background simulations.

### Added

* **EventCalc LLP event generator**
  This modification introduces a first implementation of the EventCalc decay
  event sampler in FairShip for inclusive final states. For further details,
  consult the dedicated presentation at the 30th SHiP CM
  [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1448055/contributions/6142341/attachments/2939894/5165450/SHiP_collaboration_meeting_talk_MFerrillo.pdf). See also #528.
* Add a conversion script `FairShip/macro/convertEvtCalc.py` to convert the
  EventCalc output sampled kinematics (.dat) as input to the simulation script
  (.root). _Remark_: This will eventually become unnecessary when this
  conversion is implemented within the EventCalc tool itself.

### Fixed

* Fix compilation warnings due to unused or uninitiliazed variables #481

### Changed

* shipStrawTracking: Move to argparse
* CMake: Use external genfit2

  history for reference
