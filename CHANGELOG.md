# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
Calendar Versioning (year.month), with the possibility of patch releases
(year.month.patch).

Until April 2024 (inclusive) no changelog was kept. We might try to reconstruct
it in future.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Add an experimental script to compare histograms.
- Add an experimental script to quickly check for overlaps.
- Time-shift MuonDIS interactions to be consistent with the original incoming muon. Tracks from soft interactions and the muon's veto response are now preserved.
- Add a custom `CrossSection` branch to the simulation file to save DIS cross sections from MuonDIS.
- Add the new `warm_opt` warm muon shield in `geometry_config`.
- Add new parameters to the muon shield to support configurations from the current optimization campaign.
- Add an `event_inspector` class to the experimental `analysis_toolkit` to streamline the use of helper functions.
- Add an optional MgB2 field map.
- Add `LOG` `info` and `fatal` to `ShipBFieldMap`.
- Add the `SND` folder for new versions of SND integrated with the Muon Shield.
- Introduce the first version of the `MTC` (`SND/MTC`), with a fully implemented scintillator part and a simplified Sci-Fi part. Geometrical parameters are stored in `geometry/MTC_config.yaml`.
- Add the `--SND_design` key to `macro/run_simScript.py` to select SND options.
- Add the `New_HA_Design` MS design in `geometry_config.py`, based on the `warm_opt` MS with a new version of HA.
- Add access to decoded numbers (stations, views, etc.) of straw tube hits.
- Add the June 2025 target configuration.
- Define pressured helium for the target at 200 and 90 degrees Celsius.
- Add a backport for the new `TFile`/`TDirectory` `__getitem__` pythonization.
- Add the `SND/EmulsionTarget` folder with `Target` and `TargetTracker` classes from `nutaudet`.
- Add a fibre structure for the MTC and digitization. The fibre-SiPM mapping is defined in `SND/MTC/MTCDetector.cxx` and can be tested in `python/SciFiMapping.py`.
- Implement the proximity shielding design from 26/06/2025 by G. Humphreys.
- Add a hole for the SND in the Muon Shield, created automatically when the SND key is enabled.
- Implement a vacuum in the target facility.
- Implement a target helium vessel.
- Add a z-offset to `FixedTargetGenerator`.
- Add missing --FixedTarget option to run_simScript.py.
- feat: Support for multiple SND designs in simulation setup
  - The `--SND_design` option in `macro/run_simScript.py` now accepts multiple values and an 'all' option to enable all available SND designs.
  - The geometry configuration and detector setup (`geometry/geometry_config.py`, `python/shipDet_conf.py`) have been updated to instantiate all requested SND detectors.
  - This enables running with multiple SND subdetectors simultaneously and is future-proof for additional SND designs.

- Fix SplitCal strip dimensions and the number of modules.
- Ensure the web viewer is disabled when checking for geometry overlaps (workaround for [root-project/root#18881](httpshttps://github.com/root-project/root/issues/18881)).
- Fix a crash due to string formatting in `EvtCalc`.
- Fix the field direction of the first magnet in Section 2.
