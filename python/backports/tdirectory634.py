    Method that is assigned to TDirectory.__getitem__. It relies on Get to

    - Raising an AttributeError if the object does not exist
    - Caching the result of a successful get for future re-attempts.
    Once cached, the same object is retrieved every time.
    This pythonization is inherited by TDirectoryFile and TFile.

    ```
    myfile.mydir.mysubdir.myHist.Draw()
