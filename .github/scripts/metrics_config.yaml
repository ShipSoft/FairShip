# Configuration for physics metrics extraction and comparison
#
# This file controls what metrics are extracted from ROOT files and how
# they are compared. Modify this file to customise metric extraction without
# changing Python code.

files:
  # ROOT files to process for metrics extraction
  # Add or remove files as needed for your simulation/reconstruction chain
  process:
    - ship.conical.Pythia8-TGeant4.root
    - ship.conical.Pythia8-TGeant4_rec.root
    - ship.conical.Pythia8-TGeant4_ana.root
    - recohists.root

extraction:
  # Maximum directory depth for recursive histogram extraction
  # Higher values search deeper into ROOT file directory structures
  # but increase processing time
  max_histogram_depth: 2

  # Fit function names to search for in histograms
  # Functions are checked in order; first match is used
  # Add custom fit function names as needed
  fit_functions:
    - gaus
    - pol1
    - expo

comparison:
  # Default tolerances for metric comparison
  # These can be overridden via command-line arguments

  # Relative tolerance for floating-point comparisons
  # Used for metrics with compare="float"
  float_tolerance: 1.0e-9

  # Number of standard deviations for statistical comparisons
  # Used for metrics with compare="statistical"
  n_sigma: 3.0
