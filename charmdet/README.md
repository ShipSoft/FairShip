# Simulation for Charm cross section and Muon flux measurements

## Geometry classes

This folder contains the geometry classes for the detectors used in charm cross section and Muon flux measurements.

Classes currently used by charm simulation:

* `Box` class: Emulsion Target 
* `Spectrometer` class: Pixel and SciFi detectors
* `MufluxSpectrometer` class: Goliath structure and Drift Tubes T3 and T4  
* `MuonTagger` class: RPCs for muon identification  


Classes currently used by muon flux simulation:  

* `MufluxSpectrometer` class: Tracking stations T1 through T4
* `MuonTagger` class: RPCs for muon identification
* `Scintillator` class: drift tube trigger scintillators (i.e. S2)
* `ReProcessAbsorber`

`Point` classes are used for MonteCarlo simulations and contain MC truth
information, `Hit` class when present are used for digitization and
reconstruction (used for muon flux measurement, still absent for charm cross
section)

## Simulations for charm cross section measurement

In general:

Option `--CharmdetSetup 1` activates charm cross section geometry, while
`--CharmdetSetup 0` activates muon flux geometry.

Option `--CharmTarget ntarget` allows to choose the emulsion target.
ntarget can assume the following values:

* 1: A brick of 29 emulsions, interleaved with 28 1 mm-thick slabs of lead;
* 2: 1 passive lead block of 28 mm, followed by a brick of 29 emulsions, interleaved with 28 1 mm-thick slabs of lead;
* 3: 1 passive lead block of 56 mm, followed by a brick of 57 emulsions, interleaved with 56 1 mm-thick slabs of lead;
* 4: 2 passive lead blocks of 56 mm, followed by a brick of 57 emulsions, interleaved with 56 1 mm-thick slabs of lead;
* 5: 3 passive lead blocks of 56 mm, followed by a brick of 57 emulsions, interleaved with 56 1 mm-thick slabs of lead;
* 6: 4 passive lead blocks of 56 mm, followed by a brick of 57 emulsions, interleaved with 56 1 mm-thick slabs of lead;
* 16: same as 1, but with tungsten as a material for passive slabs instead of lead (CH1-R6 exposure)

Only the most useful options have been explained here. For the complete list of
available options please refer to the related scripts.

Charm production simulations are done from `macro/run_simScript.py`. Example
syntax:  `python $FAIRSHIP/macro/run_simScript.py --charm 1 -A charmonly
--CharmdetSetup 1 --CharmTarget 1 -f Cascadefile -n 1000 -o outputfolder`

Useful options:
* `--charm 1`: activates `charmdet` configuration instead of SHiP standard (both
  for charm cross section and muon flux measurements)
* `-A charmonly`: activates
  charm production simulation
* `-f`: input file with charm vertices (if you have Kerberos configured (e.g.
  by default on `lxplus`), this will be taken directly
  from `/eos/ship/data/Charm/Cascade-parp16-MSTP82-1-MSEL4-978Bpot.root` by
  default)
* `-n`: number of events
* `-o`: output of folder where geometry and output of simulation will be saved  

General POT simulations are done from
`muonShieldOptimization/run_MufluxfixedTarget.py`. Example of syntax:
 
 `python $FAIRSHIP/muonShieldOptimization/run_MufluxfixedTarget.py
 --CharmdetSetup 1 --CharmTarget 1 -G -e 0.001 -n 1000 -o outputfolder`
 
 It is a derivation of the fixed target simulation used in SHiP, applied to
 `charmdet` geometry.
 
 Useful options:
 
* `-e`: Energy cut for adding tracks to `Geant4` propagation (choosing a high cut
  allows to save memory for larger simulations)
* `-n`: Number of events
* `-o`: output of folder where geometry and output of simulation will be saved
* `-r`: number of run (can be used as folder naming if `-o` option is not used)
* `-f` : force overwriting of directory (DANGEROUS: if used in a wrong
    directory, it will delete it. DO NOT USE IT together with `-o` option)  


Different options for proton generation:

* `-V`: default one, proton interactions generated with `Pythia` and `EvtGen` is
  used for decays
* `-P`: both proton interactions and decays handled with `Pythia`
* `-G`: most basic simulation: one 400 GeV proton directly sent to `Geant4`

Details can be found here: <https://cds.cern.ch/record/2280572>.

All simulations use `Geant4` for propagation. IMPORTANT: Both `-V` and `-P`
generate all interactions in target. Due to small dimensions of target used in
`charmdet` measurement, many protons pass through without interacting. To
correctly simulate surviving protons and their tracks in detectors, use `-G`
option.

## Simulations for muon flux measurements

* For full simulation, proton (400 GeV) on SHiP muflux target, plus detector setup:
 `python  run_MufluxfixedTarget.py -e ecut -P --CharmdetSetup 0`
  more options available (boosting di-muon BR, di-muon cross sections,
  charmonium, charm, ...), see `--help`
* For fast simulation, with muons from external file:
`python  run_simScript.py --MuonBack -n 1000 --charm=1 --CharmdetSetup=0 -f
inputFile`, where `inputFile`:
`/eos/experiment/ship/data/Mbias/background-prod-2018/pythia8_Geant4_10.0_withCharmandBeauty0_mu.root`
(+ 66 more files)
* For digitization:
`python runMufluxDigi.py -f ship.conical.FixedTarget-TGeant4.root -g
geofile_full.conical.FixedTarget-TGeant4.root`â†’
`ship.conical.FixedTarget-TGeant4_dig.root` Track reconstruction & analysis use
`drifttubeMonitoring.py`, will automatically detect if it is MC data.


## Checking geometry output  Event display can be launched in the following way:
`python -i $FAIRSHIP/macro/eventDisplay.py -f simulationfile.root -g
geofile.root`

(actual names of `simulationfile.root` and `geofile.root` depend on the
launched simulation)

Positions and dimensions of volumes can be checked in the following way:
`python $FAIRSHIP/macro/getGeoInformation.py -g geofile.root`
 
Useful options:

* `-v`: name of the volume to expand (see list of volume daughters)
* `-l`: 'depth' level of the subnode expansion (how many daughters are showed)
